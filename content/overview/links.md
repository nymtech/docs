## The Nym Project

* You can chat to us in [Keybase](https://keybase.io). Download the app, then click **Teams -> Join a team**. Type `nymtech.friends` into the team name and hit **continue**. For general chat, hang out in the **#general** channel. Our development takes places in the **#dev** channel. Node operators should be in the **#node-operators** channel to receive notice of system updates or node downtime.
